                <p id="covid-19">In order to keep our clients safe and healthy, as well as our staff, some of our procedures will be a little different. We will be allowing a space of time between appointments to give time to wipe down areas, pens, etc.. We will also be cleaning countertops, chairs, work spaces, door handles, etc. periodically through the day. Even though appointments are available, please feel free to access us through any of the following ways: mail, email, fax, access the portal, call, face time and/or drop off paperwork in person or in the back mail slot of our building.</p>
