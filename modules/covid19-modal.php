We will continue doing payroll, bookkeeping and tax preparation as usual. In order to keep our clients safe and healthy, as well as our staff, some of our procedures will be a little different. Even though our doors are locked there are several ways that you can get information to us and for us to get information to you. You can mail, email, fax, access the portal, call, face time and/or drop off paperwork in the back mail slot of our building. We are here working and available.</p>
